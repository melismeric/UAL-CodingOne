## Extra Project

I wanted to do a practice project using three.js and shaders. I splitted the scene into 4 rooms and created a exhibition. In the first room we can move the lights with mouse and see differet shadows they create. 
In the second room I created a shader with noise. I wanted it to reflect lights from the other rooms, hence I added these lights inside the shader.
In the third room I played with another shader. 
In the last room there are lights randomly placed. I wanted to practice raycasting in this room. When the mouse is over a light it changes color radomly.
